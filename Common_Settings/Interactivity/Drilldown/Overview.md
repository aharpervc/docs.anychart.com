## Overview

Creating a chart with drilldown in AnyChart is very easy and can be implemented using so-called [event listeners](Event_Listeners) and amazingly {api:anychart}flexible API{api} and [data model](Working_with_Data/Overview).

This section of documentation will explain most of the basics you need to know and provide numerous samples.

## Basics

The [Drilldown Chart Basics](Basics) article will explain and show you all the basics one needs to know to start creating drilldown charts with AnyChart. There is a step by step tutorial that covers and explains every new line in the code.

## Treemap

[TreeMap](Basic_Charts/TreeMap_Chart) is a special type of charts intended to demonstrate hierarchically ordered data structures and it has special methods to work with drilldown and drillup. Please see [Drilldown in TreeMap Charts](Basic_Charts/TreeMap_Chart#interactivity) to learn more.

## Geo Maps

[Geo Maps](Maps/Quick_Start) are a special type and working with drilldown with them differs from other chart types, please see [Drilldown in Geo Maps](Maps/Drill_Down_Maps/Overview) article to learn more.

### Sample Drilldown Dashboard

To showcase drilldown and interactivity options of AnyChart Charts and Maps we have created a sample application in [AnyChart Solutions](http://www.anychart.com/solutions/) section.

Demo application: [http://demos.anychart.dev/demos/ENV-596-drill-down-demo/](http://demos.anychart.dev/demos/ENV-596-drill-down-demo/)

You can download and grab the source code to use it to study or a base for your own application.
